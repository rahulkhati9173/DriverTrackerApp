DriverTrackerApp - minimal project generated by assistant

IMPORTANT:
- This is a source ZIP intended for developers. You still need Android Studio / Gradle to build the APK,
  or configure GitHub Actions properly to build on remote runners.
- Add your Firebase 'google-services.json' file into app/ folder before building.
- The provided GitHub Actions workflow is a template; you may need to include Gradle wrapper or modify the workflow.

Quick local build (recommended):
1. Install Android Studio on a PC.
2. Open this folder as an Android Studio project.
3. Place google-services.json into app/ directory.
4. Sync Gradle and Build > Build APK(s).

Quick GitHub build idea:
- Create a GitHub repository and push this project.
- Add a workflow (provided .github/workflows/android.yml) and test; you might need to include Gradle wrapper files.

- app/src/main/java/com/example/drivertracker/ : Java source files (MainActivity, LocationService, FirebaseHelper, PhotoItem)
- app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml : UI layout
- app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- build.gradle, settings.gradle
- placeholder app/google-services.json (replace with your file)
